Assignment: Simple Backend API Development with TypeScript

Approach: For this assignment I used Nodejs and Express for the backend API development.Then use typscript for strict typing.Initially I initialize the npm and install all the necessary and required packages. All the respective folders are created given their name as per the purpose. In this api development I used Sqlite as lightweight database. In the index.ts file server is created and separate database file is also created to connect to the database, a table is then constructed to insert the data for the todo list items. In the model folder an interface will tell the data to be inserted to follow its type. Finally at the routes folder all the api to perform the basic CURD operation is coded with nodejs, also sqlite queries are implemented for each the respective apis. I used Postman to test the APIs.

Challenges: Since this is first time in the backend development that I used Sqlite as database I required some reading of the documentation. Whenever there is a bug I would look up for proper implementation of the query. Sometimes there are symbols that I forgot to put in the query which makes the api not able to perform with the database. But all are solved after reading the documentation and continuous testing of Postman API.

Improvements: Need to become more familiar with Sqlite and proper fullstack todo list app can be created.
